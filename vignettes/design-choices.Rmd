These are the rational for this package:


##  `data.table` provides an inconvenient LEFT JOIN mechanism.  

In `data.table` the LEFT JOINS occur by putting the LHS of the join on the 
right, e.g.

     X[DT, on="x"]                         # left join

where DT is the LHS join table.  This just looks ugly.


## COLUMN NAME COLLISIONS are not insufficiently disambiguated 

`data.table` prefixes column-name collisions with `x.` and `i.`.  `dplyr` 
suffixes with `.x` and `.y`.  These names are not descriptive enough for joins 
where lots of tables are brought together.  


## COLUMN ORDERING is not (always) preserved.

The column ordering should be preserved keeping LHS columns on the LHS.
